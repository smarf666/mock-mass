        <h1>Apply for Unemployment Benefits</h1>
        <h4>Have you lost your job? You may qualify for Unemployment Insurance (UI),</h4>
        <h4>which is temporary income to support you while you look for a new one.</h4>
        <p style="padding-top: 2%;width: 700px;">You should apply for unemployment benefits during your first week of
            total or partial unemployment. Most
            claims are processed within 21-28 days after filing. It may take longer if there is an issue with your
            claim.</p>

            <h3>What you need</h3>
            <p>To apply for Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits, you need to provide personal information including
                your Social
                Security number, birth date, home address, email address (optional), and phone number.

                You also need information about your employment history from the last 15 months, including:

                Names of all employers, plus addresses and phone numbers
                Reasons for leaving those jobs
                Work start and end dates
                Recall date (if you were laid off but have a set date to return to work)
                You may need additional information in certain situations:

                If you are not a U.S. citizen — your Alien Registration number
                If you have children — their birth dates and Social Security numbers
                If you’re in a union — your union name and local number
                If you were in the military — your DD-214 Member 4 form. If you don’t have it, you can request your
                DD-214 online.
                If you worked for the federal government — your SF8 form (optional)
                To receive payments by direct deposit, you’ll also need your bank name, account number, and routing
                number. Otherwise,
                the Department of Unemployment Assistance (DUA) will send you a debit card.

                If you’re a non-U.S. citizen applying for UI benefits, DUA must verify that you are legally authorized
                to work in the
                United States.

                If you're not sure that UI is right for you, you can check your eligibility.
